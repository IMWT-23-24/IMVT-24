        <p> Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (/rɛmbrænt, 15 July 1606[1] – 4 October 1669), usually simply known as Rembrandt, 
            was a Dutch Golden Age painter, printmaker, and draughtsman. 
            An innovative and prolific master in three media,[3] 
            he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists 
            in the history of art.[4] It is estimated Rembrandt produced 
            a total of about three hundred paintings, three hundred etchings, 
            and two thousand drawings.</p>

        <h3>Early life and education </h3>
        <p> Rembrandt[a] Harmenszoon van Rijn was born on 15 July 1606 in Leiden,[1] in the Dutch Republic, 
            now the Netherlands. He was the ninth child born to Harmen Gerritszoon van Rijn and 
            Neeltgen Willemsdochter van Zuijtbrouck.[10] His family was quite 
            well-to-do; his father was a miller and his mother was a baker's daughter. 
            His mother was Catholic, and his father belonged to the Dutch Reformed 
            Church. Religion is a central theme in Rembrandt's works and the 
            religiously fraught period in which he lived makes his faith a matter 
            of interest.</p>

        <h3>Career</h3> 
        <p> In 1624 or 1625, Rembrandt opened a studio in Leiden, which he shared with friend and colleague Jan Lievens. In 1627, Rembrandt began to accept students, among them Gerrit Dou and Isaac de Jouderville.[13] Joan Huydecoper is mentioned as the first buyer of 
            a Rembrandt painting in 1628.[14] In 1629, Rembrandt was discovered by the statesman Constantijn Huygens who procured for Rembrandt important commissions from the court of The Hague. As a result of this connection, Prince Frederik Hendrik continued to purchase paintings from Rembrandt.[15]
